# Unreal Engine Infinite Tunnel Game
Infinite tunnel tutorial project, with some added features.

First Unreal Engine 4 tutorial I've tried. Instructions are here: https://www.raywenderlich.com/168091/create-simple-game-unreal-engine-4 

Added two small features to the project:
  - Passing through each tunnel increases the speed of the player
  - There are black pickups available in the tunnel that decrease the speed of the player.

The idea is, the player gets more points the faster he goes through the tunnel. Of course, if the player is going too fast, they risk losing control.
